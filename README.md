# doty.app (vue-graphql-todo-app)

Hey there! I am doty.app and your new digital task tracker. I designed to be simple yet competent web app for you to
track your task without any haste! Although I am a newcomer, I can do basic operations such as adding, editing and
deleting the tasks.

Although it's simplicity, doty.app works efficiently due to lightweight yet powerful tools such as Vue.js and GraphQL.
